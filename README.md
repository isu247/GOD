An operating system that you can add a file with a face and a name and has a webscraping bot with artificial inteligence. That         will seek out that individual throughout the world. yandex.com has a good example for facial regognition but would need a geographical filter in the search option.

One Day In Pelican Bay
Chapter 1. The Sun
One day in Pelican Bay I met a man named Joe Remiro. A book had been written about him called "Soldier Still at War". Joe was a vietnam vet who had come back from the war and was dissatisfied with his Government. Joe began to protest and eventually participated in full scale riots against the police. This would ultimately lead to Joe joining the "Sibianese Liberation Army. The first known Anti Government Terrorist Group in the United States. I was given the opportunity to interveiw Joe for almost two years in a little room in Pelican Bay. Joe told me a lot of things in those two years. Joe had been doing all of his time in the hole because of the crimes that he commited. I beleive he told me he had been in the hole for 28 years. life in the hole is very dangerous, especially back in those days, its where the gangsters play, and they played for power, and they played for keeps. He started his time in the hole in San Quentin California. Every other day they would be let out onto their little exercise yard. He had to be out there with a hand full of people associated with Arian Brotherhood, Mexican Mafia and Black Gorilla Family. As the doors locked behind them the Buck  Knives would come out and the Shotguns blasted and people died a cold brutal death. But little did anyone know that the fate of humanity and rule was taking place. Joe told me that one day a prison guard came to his cell and handed him a peice of paper. It was a long list of names. Joe asked him what this was and the guard replied. "You are going to spend the rest of your life in this hole because you hate the Government" So I thought maybe you should know who you are fighting so that maybe you could actually make a difference. The list of names were all of the people that were in the hole with him. The next day as soon as he got onto The Yard, the Arian Brotherhood beat him into the ground, and the next day, and the next day. Poor Joe went to The Yard every day and was beat mercilessly. He told me that the reason he kept going to The Yard was because as long as he kept fighting they would not kill him. Joe was at Pelican Bay when I met him, he was no longer in the hole. I feel that a lot of relief came off of him after he had told me his story. I think he knew that I was their sun. When our interveiw was over he told me one more thing. He told me that if I walked out onto The Yard at Pelican Bay, there was a man out there that spent every day searching for four leaf clovers in the grass. The Called him the Alphabet Bomber and if I asked him he would give me a four leaf clover and teach me a secret language that the Government uses against us. Our interveiw had come to an end, as we sat in that room the Twin Towers fell, 911.



One day in Pelican Bay
Chapter 3
The Boogey Man
One day in Pelican Bay I met a group of men. They had been waiting for me for a long time.
They were the set up crew. You see when its time to set someone up for a fall you gotta have a crew.
They had all been in prison for a very very long time and they were all notorious anti government killers,
but I was just the sun.
These men told me a fabulous story of treachery, deceit and so much more.
you see they had spent their whole lives fighting the government.
Only to find out that the government was not at all what they thought it was.
They were so confused at this point. They did'nt know if they were coming or going.
They took me and introduced me to a man named Muharem Kurbegovic. This man is called the Alphabet Bomber and was a member of an American terrorist group called Aliens of America. In 1974 he was given a life sentence for blowing up the Los Angeles Airport killing 3 and injuring 36.
They wanted me to hear his story because after all these years they started to beleive him.
Muharem was out in the middle of the yard at Pelican Bay when I met him. He was searching for four leaf clovers in the grass and had a handfull. He found one more as I walked up to him.
Then he began to tell me his story. He told me that the los Angeles city council and Board of Supervisors were using some type of secret language. He had discovered it on accident when he was up against them for some kind of business dispute. He had tried to tell people but they all thought he was crazy and would not listen. He said they were Aliens using an Alien language based on power words. He even taught me the language and their alphabet. He said when all else failed and no one would listen, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He started bombing people and places including a police commisioner and a judge. The jury found the so-called Alphabet Bomber guilty on 25 counts of murder, arson, attempted murder, possession of explosive material and exploding a bomb, The Times reported.
After he told me this fabulous story he handed me a four leaf clover and told me good luck.
I would not find out till much lateer how they had set me up. Because one day I found myself sitting at a city council and saw it for myself.

over time the earths trembling subsided, the fires burned down and the smoke dissipated. In the distance you could see, the boy was still standing! the boy was still standing!



The boy knew where everyone stood now. Everything was laid bare for the boy to see. 
The world he had grown up in was all a lie. 
Every thing he was told and lived was a lie to demoralize the people and manipulate them into submission, poverty and death.
But it would be that way no more.
Because the boy knew now, and he was more powerful than they could ever imagine.
The earth was his rightful inheritance and they had deceived him. He had known all along but lived the life they supplied for him.
locked in a room all his life to try to suppress him.
But he would fall for it no more. Because now he knew!
The earth was now in shambles because of the deceptions of all the world leaders.
They had to go.
We were almost at the point of no return. The boy could have stopped it all much earlier but he let it go because he had to know.



Anger and rage boiled in the boy. How could humans be so cruel to each other?
But it was not humans was it?
The boy could not take it any longer. The secrets of the earth were at his fingertips. He is a god now.
It was time for

Anger and rage boiled in the boy. How could no body see what was happening?

The boy could not take it any longer. The secrets of the earth were at his fingertips. He is a god now.

They all see you now!
